Renewable Energy Production Prediction

Predicting renewable energy production can be crucial for optimizing energy grids, managing resources, and integrating renewable sources more effectively. Here's a detailed breakdown of this project idea:

Goal: Build a model to predict the amount of electricity generated by a renewable energy source (solar) based on historical data and relevant factors.
